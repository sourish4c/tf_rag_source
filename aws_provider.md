### Terraform code to create provider

The provider.tf file in Terraform is a configuration file that specifies the AWS cloud and its corresponding plugin that Terraform will use to manage resources in that provider. Use the below code as it is while generating terraform code for AWS cloud

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~>5"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region  = "us-east-1"
}
```
